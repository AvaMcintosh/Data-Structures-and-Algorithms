# Overview
In this project I will choose between chaining or probing to handle collision resolution for a Hash Table. 

# Given Code
1. HashTable.h
  - Header file
  - Declaration of all methods
  - Decide on data structure for hash table, based on collision resolution approach
2. HashTable.cpp
  - Stubs for all the methods for HashTable and HashTableBucket classes
  - HashTableBucket methods have all been written

# Tasks
1. Handle collision resolution
  - Chaining
  - Probing
2. Add appropriate data structure into HashTable class
3. Writing the bodies of the HashTable methods
4. Storing the data
  - Chaining
  - Open Adressing
5. Table Resizing
6. Report the time complexity of
  - Insert
  - Remove
  - Contains
  - Get
  - Operator[]

# Topics for Review
1. Hash Table
2. C ++ syntax
  - Header file
  - cpp file
3. Map ADT
4. Collision Resolution
  - Chaining
  - Probing
      * Pseudo-random
      * Double Hashing
5. Enum BucketType
6. Data Storage
  - Chaining
      * What is a C++ Container? (List, Vector)
  - Open Addressing
      * Pseudo Random Probing
      * Double Hashing
7. Time Complexity
